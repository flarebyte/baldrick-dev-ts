# Complex Title That Might Be Too Long For Some Linters But Should Be Fine

-   item one using star marker (should be dash)
-   item two with _italic_ using star emphasis (should be underscore), and
    a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
    long line that should be wrapped.

1.  ordered item one
2.  ordered item two

A paragraph with a link: [Example](https://example.com) and some _italic_ and
**bold** text.

| h1 | h2 |
| -- | -- |
| c1 | c2 |

```
const foo = (bar) => {
  console.log(bar)
}
```

> a quoted line that is also much much much much much much much longer
> than the recommended width and should therefore be wrapped properly
> when fixed.
